# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to publish a Docker image to GitHub Packages
# whenever a new release is published in the repository.

# The workflow is triggered by the 'release' event, specifically when a release is published.

# The workflow consists of a single job named 'push_to_github_packages' which runs on the latest Ubuntu runner.

# The job has the following permissions:
# - Write access to packages
# - Read access to repository contents
# - Write access to the id-token

# The job includes the following steps:
# 1. Check out the repository using the actions/checkout@v4 action.
# 2. Log in to GitHub Packages using the docker/login-action@v2 action with the GitHub actor's username and a GitHub token.
# 3. Extract metadata (tags, labels) for the Docker image using the docker/metadata-action@v3 action.
# 4. Build and push the Docker image using the docker/build-push-action@v3 action, with the context set to the root directory,
#    the Dockerfile specified, and the tags and labels obtained from the metadata extraction step.
